* Installation

/tabgo/ is available through [[https://melpa.org/#/tabgo][MELPA]]. If you have it set up already, just do ~M-x package-install tabgo~ and you are good to go. Otherwise please see [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA getting started]] page to learn how you can install packages through MELPA or see the following installation options.

Another way to install /tabgo/ would be using either [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight]] or [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa]] package managers:

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Using straight:
  (use-package tabgo
    :straight (:host github :repo "isamert/tabgo.el"))

  ;; Using quelpa:
  (use-package tabgo
    :quelpa (tabgo :fetcher github :repo "isamert/tabgo.el"))
#+end_src

Yet another option is just downloading =tabgo.el= file and putting into your =load-path=, afterwards you can simply do the following in your =init.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'tabgo)
#+end_src

* Usage

To use ~tabgo~, bind the ~tabgo~ function to a key of your choice:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key global-map (kbd "M-t") #'tabgo)
#+end_src

Once you have bound ~tabgo~, you can call it by pressing the key you bound it to. You'll see that highlighted characters appear on the tab-bar and tab-line tab names. Simply press the one that you want to go to and ~tabgo~ will switch to it for you.

There are also ~tabgo-line~ and ~tabgo-bar~ functions that you can use, ~tabgo~ is simply combination of these functions.

* Customization

~tabgo~ comes with two customizable variables that allow you to bind specific keys to select tabs in the ~tab-line~ and ~tab-bar~. These variables are:

- ~tabgo-tab-bar-keys~ :: keys to use for selecting ~tab-bar~ tabs.
- ~tabgo-tab-line-keys~ :: keys to use for selecting ~tab-line~ tabs.

You can customize these variables by setting them either as a string containing the characters you want to use or as a list of characters.

* Limitations

- ~tabgo~ does not highlight tabs if there are no keys left in the ~tabgo-tab-bar-keys~ or ~tabgo-tab-line-keys~. This is intentional because I want to have keys to appear in a deterministic way.
